Dimmer
========

Dimmer add-on for firefox.  

When this add-on is enabled every page will be dimmed by a configurable 
percentage.  

A context menu allows for specific domains to be exempt from dimming.


Note that domains that have been specified as exempt are stored in a file in
the user's profile directory.  If the window is in private browsing mode
the exemptions specified in that window will not be stored.
