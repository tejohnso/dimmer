Dimmer
========

Dimmer add-on for firefox.  

When this add-on is enabled every page will be dimmed by a configurable 
percentage.  

A context menu allows for specific domains to be exempt from dimming.


Alternatively, behaviour can be set so that all pages are left not dimmed
except for pages that have been specified using the context menu. 

Note that domains that have been specified as exempt are stored in a file in
the user's profile directory.  If the window is in private browsing mode
the exemptions specified in that window will not be stored.
